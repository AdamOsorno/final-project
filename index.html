  <h1>What is a Chain throw and why should you care?</h1>
    <p class="chainthrow">
        In Tekken, a chain throw is a series of throws done sequentially in a combo in order to deal insane amounts of damage. Each part of a chain throw requires a new input by the thrower in order for the throw to be executed. The thrower is not the only one who has options however, as with each new input required, that gives the throwee the option to escape (break) the throw.
That’s where this website comes in! The objective of it is to provide a nice no risk environment to learn how to break these throws so that you can stand a chance against the grapplers of the online world. You will be presented with a simulation of being caught in a chain grab and options to get out of that throw. Guess correctly and congratulations! You’ve escaped! An Incorrect Guess will take you to a losing screen where you can either try again or go back to the start of the chain. Good luck and have fun!

<h2>What is the Rolling Death Cradle?</h2>
<p>
  The Rolling Death Cradle (often shortened to RDC) Is a Chain throw that is accessable by the character King. It is a throw where King first breaks the arm of his victim then curls them in a ball an rolls around with them on the ground. This chain does the most damage of any throw in the game (despite how ridiculous it looks) and can be devestating for new players to try to figure out. Good thing for you, the first iteration of this website will teach you to escape this very throw, because would you want to take this amount of damage if you can avoid it?

<h4>What is a 1 break?</h4>
<p>A "break" is an input you enter to escape a throw. Inputs in the context of Tekken are notated using numbers, rather than traditional button names.</p>
