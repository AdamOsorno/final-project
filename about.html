        In Tekken, a chain throw is a series of throws done sequentially in a combo in order to deal insane amounts of damage. Each part of a chain throw requires a new input by the thrower in order for the throw to be executed. The thrower is not the only one who has options however, as with each new input required, that gives the throwee the option to escape (break) the throw.
That’s where this website comes in! The objective of it is to provide a nice no risk environment to learn how to break these throws so that you can stand a chance against the grapplers of the online world. You will be presented with a simulation of being caught in a chain grab and options to get out of that throw. Guess correctly and congratulations! You’ve escaped! An Incorrect Guess will take you to a losing screen where you can either try again or go back to the start of the chain. Good luck and have fun!
